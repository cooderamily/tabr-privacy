        <h1>Privacy Policy for tabr</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: July 16, 2024</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>tabr</strong> ("we," "us," or "our") handles information in connection with your use of the <strong>tabr</strong> Chrome extension (the "Extension").</p>

        <h2>1. No Personal Data Collection</h2>
        <p>We believe in privacy and simplicity. Our Extension is designed to be a beautiful and minimal addition to your browser. We do not collect, store, sell, or share any of your Personal Identifiable Information (PII).</p>
        <p>This includes, but is not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your name or email address</li>
            <li>Your IP address</li>
            <li>Your Browse history, cookies, or website data</li>
            <li>Your location data</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Non-Personal Data</h2>
        <p>The Extension operates entirely on your local machine. All functionalities and data are handled client-side.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Settings:</strong> Any settings you configure for the Extension, such as image preferences, are stored locally on your computer using the standard Chrome browser storage APIs (<code>chrome.storage</code>). This data is never transmitted to our servers.</li>
            <li><strong>Cached Images:</strong> To improve performance and provide a faster experience, the Extension may cache background images on your local device. This cache can be cleared at any time by clearing your browser's cache or reinstalling the Extension.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
        <p>Since we do not collect any personal information, we do not use your information in any way.</p>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The images displayed in the new tab may be sourced from third-party APIs (e.g., Unsplash, Pexels, or your own image source). While our Extension does not share your data with them, these services have their own privacy policies. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties.</p>

        <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our Extension is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any information from children.</p>

        <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>

        <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us:</p>
