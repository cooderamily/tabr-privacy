📄 Privacy Policy for Chrome Extension

Effective Date: [Insert Date]

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our Chrome Extension (hereinafter referred to as “the Extension”).

1. Information We Collect

We are committed to collecting as little user data as possible. Depending on the features of the Extension, we may collect the following types of information:
	•	Non-personal information, such as error logs and usage statistics, to help us improve the Extension.
	•	Local data, such as your settings or preferences, stored in your browser’s local storage.
	•	No personally identifiable information (PII) is collected — we do not collect names, email addresses, or other identifiable data.

✅ If your extension accesses sensitive information (e.g., web page content, clipboard, browsing history, user input), you must explicitly list and explain it here.

2. How We Use the Information

Any information we collect is used strictly for the following purposes:
	•	To improve the performance and functionality of the Extension.
	•	To identify and fix bugs or technical issues.
	•	To analyze anonymous usage data for better user experience.

We do not sell, rent, or share your information with third parties.

3. Third-Party Services

This Extension may use third-party services (such as Google Analytics or Sentry) to collect anonymous usage data. These services have their own privacy policies, which we recommend reviewing separately.

4. Data Storage and Security

All data is either stored locally on your browser or securely transmitted and stored using encryption methods. We take reasonable security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access.

5. Your Rights

You have the right to uninstall the Extension at any time and clear any stored data from your browser settings.

6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. If any material changes are made, we will notify you through the Extension or on the Chrome Web Store listing page.

7. Contact Us

If you have any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, you may contact us at:
	•	Email: [your_email@example.com]

Let me know if you’d like to tailor this further — for example, to mention clipboard access, content scripts, remote APIs, or OAuth scopes.
