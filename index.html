  <h1>Privacy Policy for Chrome Extension</h1>
  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <li><strong>Non-personal information</strong>, such as error logs and usage statistics, to help us improve the Extension.</li>
    <li><strong>Local data</strong>, such as your settings or preferences, stored in your browser’s local storage.</li>
    <li><strong>No personally identifiable information (PII)</strong> is collected — we do not collect names, email addresses, or other identifiable data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use the Information</h2>
  <p>
    Any information we collect is used strictly for the following purposes:
  </p>

  <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
